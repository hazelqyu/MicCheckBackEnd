Here I stand, Fly Gull, the queen of the breeze,
My words take flight, bringin' rivals to their knees,
San Fernando's pride, with a vibe that's chill,
I'll soar through your verses, with lyrical skill.

I stack my paper high, like a mountain so majestic,
Counting all my riches, yeah, my lifestyle so hectic.
Your shoes look like they came from a bargain bodega,
In my world, luxury's the only word you ever finagle.

Yo, Fly Gull in the house, and I'm ready to soar,
San Fernando's finest, got my fans wanting more,
With these rhymes so divine, they echo through the core,
Ride the subway of beats, hear the crowd's mighty roar.

Dressed so fresh, like I just stepped out the mall.
My style's so unique, it's like a fashion fame of hall.
They try to mimic me, but can't reach my league.
You're all grounded, like birds with no wings.

You talk about trends, but I'm setting the pace,
In the rap game, it's my words that embrace,
While you're stuck on fashion, I'm flying with grace,
San Fernando's pride, in this lyrical race.

Crowd goes wild when I step to the stage.
Applause so loud, echoing through the haze.
You can't match the love, you can only cry.
While I'm feasting on success, you can't eat your fries.

Fries or no fries, I'm on a lyrical diet,
My bars are so hot, they cause a riot,
Feast on my vibes, no need to deny it,
Sunbeams in the crowd, they never keep quiet.

Got the cottontail Gummies, sweeter than a cutie.
Taste so good, it's like a sugar daddy.
While you're stuck with nothing, can't score a .
I'm living sweetly, you're missing all the homies.

You talk about sweets, but I'm the real delight,
In this game of rhymes, I take flight like a kite,
With a vibe so bright, it's shining every night,
Sunbeams standing strong, in this lyrical fight.

From the West Coast, always bringin' the most,
On this subway, watch me coast, I'm the host,
Sunbeams cheer as I fly far and wide,
Ace, let's see if you can match this vibe.

Yo, it's Fly Gull comin' through, paintin' skies with my rhyme,
From the tracks to the stage, every moment's my time,
With a beat in my soul, I cruise on life's line,
Got the Sunbeams with me, together we shine.

I'm the queen of this scene, with a rhyme machine,
From Cali to the city, where I keep it so clean,
Ace, you tryna step up, but you're just a routine,
I'm the dream on the stream, you're just a small screen.
