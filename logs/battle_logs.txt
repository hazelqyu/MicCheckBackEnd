I glide on the beat, feet too fly for the street,
Your rhymes can't compete, while mine bring the heat,
From San Fernando to the subway's sweet tune,
My bars illuminate, like the glow of the moon.

Yo, Ace, you think you're the case, but it's just a phase,
I'm breezin' through the haze, got that California craze,
Sunbeams on my back, I'm the queen of the track,
With my lyrics intact, watch your confidence crack.

I'm the king of cool, rule the scene like a 1,
While you trip and fall, looking like a 2,
Ice in my veins, I'm never gonna 3,
Your rhymes are weak, they ain't got the 4,

You talk big game, but it sounds kinda lame,
Sunbeams in my fame, I'm the one to acclaim,
While you try to rise, I'm cruisin' the skies,
Rhyme Rider surprise, watch your hopes vaporize.

I'm number one, always shining, the 1_,
You fumble two, can't even score, the 2_,
Taking the lead, while the crowd goes 3_,
Your game's so weak, can't measure up, it's 4_,

Ace, you claim the crown, but it’s a lonely throne,
Sunbeams light up my path, I’m in a league of my own,
Breezin' past the noise, in my world of rejoice,
While you're lost in the crowd, I'm the voice by choice.
